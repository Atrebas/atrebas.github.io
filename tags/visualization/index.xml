      <description>.hljs{background: #a7a7a71a;font-size: 90%;}Dendrograms in RDendrograms are diagrams useful to illustrate hierarchical relationships, such as those obtained from a hierarchical clustering. They are commonly used in biology, especially in genetics, for example to illustrate the relationships among a set of genes or taxa.
Several alternatives exist in R to visualize dendrograms (reviews here and here), like base R of course, or the ape package.</description>
