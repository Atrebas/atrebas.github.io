      <description>.hljs{background: #a7a7a71a;font-size: 90%;}Dendrograms in RDendrograms are diagrams useful to illustrate hierarchical relationships, such as those obtained from a hierarchical clustering. They are commonly used in biology, especially in genetics, for example to illustrate the relationships among a set of genes or taxa.
Several alternatives exist in R to visualize dendrograms (reviews here and here), like base R of course, or the ape package.</description>

      <description>.hljs{background: #a7a7a71a;font-size: 90%;}What if we turn images into ridgeline plots?
Ridgeline plots“Ridgeline plots are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range. They can be quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space.” - Claus Wilke.
They have been quite popular recently. Some references include:
